1. To solve problem , you can 
  1) read all the lines in that pdf file and search the word in each line. 
     You can use some packages online to help you to process PDF folders.
  2) What if the word is split into two different lines. e.g. In "The mag-
     net is big. ", the word "magnet" is saved in two lines.  (Advance option,
     don't need to do that, just think about it)
  3) What if the word is a prefix or suffix of another word? e.g. the word "magnetic"
     is also counted when you just search "magnet". Doing that by ourself is troublesome,
     maybe some packages can help.(don't need to do that, just think about possible answers)
  
2. To solve the problem, you can 
  1)  read all the lines in html file. HTML file is a kind of txt file, just process it like normal txt files.
  2)  find those Chinese words, may need some packages or not ( I'm not sure )
  3)  save your result and write them in csv format
